      <h1>Zakynthos</h1>
      <p>
        Zakynthos (also spelled Zakinthos; Greek: Ζάκυνθος, romanized: Zákynthos
        [ˈzacinθos] (listen); Italian: Zacinto [dzaˈtʃinto]) or Zante (/ˈzænti/,
        US also /ˈzɑːnteɪ/,[1][2] Italian: [ˈdzante]; Greek: Τζάντε, romanized:
        Tzánte [ˈdza(n)de]; from the Venetian form) is a Greek island in the
        Ionian Sea. It is the third largest of the Ionian Islands. Zakynthos is
        a separate regional unit of the Ionian Islands region, and its only
        municipality. It covers an area of 405.55 km2 (156.6 sq mi)[3] and its
        coastline is roughly 123 km (76 mi) in length. The name, like all
        similar names ending in -nthos, is pre-Mycenaean or Pelasgian in origin.
        In Greek mythology the island was said to be named after Zakynthos, the
        son of the legendary Arcadian chief Dardanus. Zakynthos is a tourist
        destination,[4] with an international airport served by charter flights
        from northern Europe. The island's nickname is "the Flower of the
        Levant", bestowed upon it by the Venetians who were in possession of
        Zakynthos from 1484 to 1794
